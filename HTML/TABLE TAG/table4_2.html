<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>Paphiopedilum, commonly known as the <b>Slipper Orchid</b>, is a unique and fascinating type of orchid known for its slipper-shaped pouch, which serves as a trap for pollinators. Native to parts of Southeast Asia, India, and China, these terrestrial orchids grow in the forest understory, often in leaf litter or mossy areas. The pouch-shaped lip of the flower is designed to trap insects, forcing them to climb through the flower, facilitating pollination.</p>

<h2>Key characteristics include:</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Flowers:</b> Distinctive slipper-shaped lip (labellum) with vibrant colors and intricate patterns. Some varieties also feature mottled or striped leaves.</li>
<li><b>Blooming Cycle:</b> Typically blooms once a year, with flowers lasting several weeks.</li>
<li><b>Care:</b> They prefer low to medium light, cooler temperatures, and moderate humidity. They require regular watering, but the soil should be well-draining to avoid root rot.</li>
<li><b>Symbolism:</b> Paphiopedilum orchids symbolize rarity and luxury due to their exotic appearance and somewhat finicky care requirements.</b>
