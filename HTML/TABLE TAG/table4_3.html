<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>Dracula Orchids, often referred to as <b>Monkey Orchids</b>, are an exotic and intriguing type of orchid known for their distinctive, eerie-looking flowers that resemble monkey faces. Native to the cloud forests of Central and South America, particularly in Ecuador and Colombia, these orchids thrive in cool, moist environments with low light, mimicking the misty, shaded conditions of their natural habitats.</p>

<h2>Key characteristics include:</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Flowers:</b> Unique, with elongated petals and a cup-like shape that gives the appearance of a monkey face when viewed from the front. They come in a variety of colors, often with dark or muted tones.</li>
<li><b>Blooming Cycle</b> Blooms year-round in their natural habitat, but under cultivation, they may require specific cool and humid conditions to bloom successfully.</li>
<li><b>Care:</b> Dracula orchids are considered challenging to grow, needing high humidity, cool temperatures, and indirect light. They are typically grown in baskets to allow their flower spikes to hang downwards, mimicking how they grow in the wild.</li>
<li><b>Symbolism:</b> Due to their rare and striking appearance, they are associated with mystery, intrigue, and the unusual beauty of the natural world.</li>
