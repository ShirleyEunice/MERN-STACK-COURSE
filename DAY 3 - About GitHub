What is GITHUB?
GitHub is a web-based platform that allows users to collaborate on code, web pages, and other content. 
It's a popular tool for software developers, but can also be used by other professionals like writers, product managers, and team leaders.
GitHub is easy to use, has robust documentation and support, and encourages collaboration. 
It's used by over 4 million organizations and more than 100 million developers.

Main Activities of GITHUB:
1. Version control: GitHub uses Git, an open source version control system, to track changes to code and reduce the risk of conflicting work. 
2. Collaboration: GitHub allows multiple people to work on a project at the same time, and provides tools to manage changes from multiple developers. 
3. Sharing: Users can store their code in a "repository" on GitHub, and share it with others. 
4. Review: Others can review code and make suggestions to improve it. 
5. Reverting: Users can revert to previous versions if changes aren't positive.
